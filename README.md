## Introduction

For this project, we are leveraging the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to access the latest information about TV shows, movies, and prominent figures in the entertainment industry, enhancing the TV/movie-watching experience.

TMDb API Documentation: [TMDb API Documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)

## Motivation

By utilizing the TMDb API, one can recommend TV shows, movies, and other entertainment based on users' preferences, genres, actors, likes, and dislikes. This integration allows us to:
- Discover details about upcoming TV shows and movies.
- Identify the most popular and/or exclusive/new content at any given time.
